# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# In line 50, when we initialize the robin variable to a new SongBird object, we pass in 3 arguments. In the initialize method definition in the SongBird class, it takes 3 arguments for the
# parameters: diet, superpower, and song.
# The song parameter is assigned to the @song instance variable, but the remaining two parameters are meant to be used as arguments for the superclass' initialize method invocation, but those
# are not passed in as arguments correctly.
