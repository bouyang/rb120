# Example

ada = Person.new('Ada')
ada.location = GeoLocation.new(53.477, -2.236)

grace = Person.new('Grace')
grace.location = GeoLocation.new(-33.89, 151.277)

ada.teleport_to(-33.89, 151.277)

puts ada.location                   # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts grace.location                 # (-33.89, 151.277)
puts ada.location == grace.location # expected: true
                                    # actual: false

# Because the == operator is not defined as a custom method in the GeoLocation class, it will go up the method lookup chain to the Object class and look for a == method there.
# The Object's == method compares each side of the == operator by seeing if they are the same object (ie. same object_id), but in this case, ada and grace's location objects
# have the same value but are not the same object, thus it returns false.
# To correct this, we have to write a custom == instance method in the GeoLocation class
